//! The widget set, bounded by what Milestone 5's terminal needs.
//!
//! **Widgets are functions returning [`Element`]s**, not node kinds. A button is a fill with
//! a label on it that happens to carry a message; the runtime knows nothing about buttons.
//! That falls out of the declarative model rather than being a decision on top of it — and it
//! means a widget's correctness is the correctness of a pure function returning a tree, which
//! is the cheapest kind of thing to test in this repository.
//!
//! ## Widgets take their state as an argument
//!
//! There is no hover flag hidden inside a `Button`. `view(&state) -> Element` is the model, so
//! whether a button is hovered is *state*, and the application passes it in — reading it from
//! [`Router::inside`](crate::route::Router::inside) if it wants to. The alternative is
//! interaction state retained in the widget tree, which `widget-toolkit.md` §3 reserves for
//! things the application has no opinion about, and a button's appearance is not one of them.
//!
//! That keeps every widget here a pure function of its arguments. It also means a widget
//! cannot animate on its own, which is deferred along with the frame clock (§11).
