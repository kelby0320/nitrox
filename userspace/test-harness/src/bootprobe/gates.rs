/// Userspace now compiles for `x86_64-unknown-nitrox`, a hard-float target: `f64`
/// arithmetic lowers to `mulsd`/`addsd` instead of the `__muldf3` libcalls the old
/// soft-float target emitted, and the kernel swaps the FP register file on every context
/// switch. This gate proves that actually works, from ring 3:
///
/// - **Against integer math.** Σ v[k]² is computed in `f64` and again in `u64` and must
///   agree *exactly* — every value is a small exact integer, so the comparison is
///   bit-exact rather than epsilon-fuzzy. A self-consistent-but-wrong FPU (a bad
///   multiply, a stuck rounding mode, an `MXCSR` we failed to initialise) fails here
///   where a float-only check would not.
/// - **Round trip across a syscall.** `x → 2x+1 → (x-1)/2` is exactly invertible at
///   these magnitudes. The forward half runs, the process crosses into the kernel (and
///   may be preempted and migrated), and the inverse half must reproduce the original
///   bit patterns.
/// - **Scalar vs. AVX2, and `XCR0` from ring 3.** When the CPU has AVX2 *and* the OS
///   enabled the SSE+AVX state components — read back with `XGETBV`, which is userspace
///   independently confirming the `XCR0` write the kernel made in `fpu_init_cpu` — the
///   same sum computed through `#[target_feature(enable = "avx2")]` intrinsics must
///   match exactly. That is the per-function opt-in pattern the GUI toolkit's font and
///   image crates will use.
///
/// **Why beside the verdict and not in the demo `parent`.** It was in `parent` first, and a
/// KVM boot-loop showed it completing in only 2 of 15 runs: whoever owns the verdict races
/// the demo chain, so on a fast boot the run was adjudicated PASS while the FP workers were
/// still running — the check silently did not execute. Running it *immediately before* the
/// only `SYS_TEST_EXIT(PASS)` call is what makes it airtight, and that property moved here
/// intact when the verdict did: `boot-probe` is now the single PASS point, and `init` starts
/// it only after the demo chain has exited zero. `parent` keeps a *concurrent* multi-process
/// version as extra breadth; this one is the guarantee.
