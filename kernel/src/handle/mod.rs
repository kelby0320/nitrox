//! Segmented kernel handle table.
//!
//! Handles are 64-bit opaque capabilities — see
//! `docs/spec/handle-encoding.md` for the wire format and
//! `docs/architecture/handle-system.md` for the implementation
//! overview. This module owns the lookup-and-allocation machinery
//! (the directory of segments, the seqlock-protected entries, the
//! deferred reclamation queue, the RCU-style grace tracker). The
//! kernel-object substrate that the entries *point at* lives in a
//! separate module — kernel objects are dispatched on
//! [`KObjectType`](crate::libkern::handle::KObjectType) and arrive in
//! the slice that follows this one.
//!
//! ## Concurrency
//!
//! Two layers of synchronisation, by design:
//!
//! - The handle-table **segment lock** (`SpinLock<Inner>`, rank 3 in
//!   [`kernel/docs/lock-ordering.md`](../../docs/lock-ordering.md))
//!   serialises allocation, close, restrict, and segment-grow
//!   bookkeeping.
//! - Each entry's **seqlock** allows lookups to proceed without
//!   acquiring the rank-3 lock in the common case. Readers loop until
//!   two `Acquire` loads bracket a metadata snapshot with matching
//!   even seq values.
//!
//! The lookup hot path takes the segment lock only when entering a
//! read-side critical section to update the grace tracker — actually
//! the lock is *not* taken; the grace tracker uses its own atomics.
//! See [`grace`].
//!
//! ## ObjectRef seam
//!
//! Step 7 of the spec's validation algorithm bumps the target kernel
//! object's refcount; [`try_acquire_refcount`] reads the
//! [`KObjectHeader`](crate::object::KObjectHeader) at offset 0 of the
//! type-erased object pointer and calls
//! [`KObjectHeader::try_acquire`](crate::object::KObjectHeader::try_acquire)
//! (`Arc`-upgrade semantics — fails if the count was already zero). On
//! the lookup success path the bumped reference is adopted into an
//! [`ObjectRef`](crate::object::ObjectRef) at step 12; on the retry and
//! error paths [`release_refcount`] drops it (running the object's
//! destructor if it was the last). A test-only override flag
//! ([`FAIL_NEXT_ACQUIRE`]) forces the step-7 failure branch
//! deterministically, since racing a real count-to-zero is not
//! reproducible. The handle-table body is unchanged from the stub era:
//! the two free functions kept the same signatures.
