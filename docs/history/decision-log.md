# Decision Log

A chronological record of project decisions that aren't captured in source
code or commit messages. Each entry includes the date, the decision, and the
reasoning behind it. Entries are append-only — supersession is recorded as a
new entry that points back to the previous one.

For the broader rationale documents that explain *why* the architecture is
shaped the way it is, see `docs/rationale/`. The decision log is for
incremental, dated choices made during implementation; the rationale
documents are for the standing positions those choices reinforce.

## 2026-05-13 — Phase 0 (foundation boot) complete

The kernel boots end-to-end on QEMU+OVMF and renders a recognisable text
indicator on the framebuffer. This proves the toolchain, the Limine
integration, and the higher-half loading work as designed.

What's in the build:

- `kernel/` — `#![no_std]`, `#![no_main]`, built against the built-in
  `x86_64-unknown-none` rustc target. Single bin `nitrox-kernel`.
- `kernel/src/limine.rs` — hand-rolled `#[repr(C)]` Limine boot-protocol
  bindings, pinned to base revision 6 (matching limine-protocol trunk as of
  Limine 12.2.0). No external Rust crates.
- `kernel/src/framebuffer.rs` + `kernel/src/font.rs` — minimal framebuffer
  console with an inline 8x16 bitmap font (uppercase letters and digits
  only — Phase 0 doesn't need more).
- `tools/xtask` — host build orchestrator: pulls the pinned
  `limine-binary.tar.gz` into `tools/build-cache/`, builds the kernel,
  assembles a 64 MiB GPT/FAT32 UEFI image via `sgdisk` + `mtools`, runs
  QEMU with OVMF. Subcommands: `build`, `image`, `qemu`, `qemu-debug`,
  `fetch-limine`, `clean`.

Decisions worth recording:

- **Built-in `x86_64-unknown-none` over a custom JSON target.** The
  built-in target already implies soft-float, no MMX/SSE, no red zone —
  exactly the semantics the kernel CLAUDE.md describes. Using it keeps us
  on stable Rust without `-Z build-std`, which is nightly-only. We can
  switch to a custom JSON later if we need a feature the built-in doesn't
  expose. (Supersedes the literal "x86_64-unknown-none.json" wording in
  `kernel/CLAUDE.md` — that file should be updated in a doc-sync pass.)
- **No NASM stub in Phase 0.** Limine drops the kernel into long mode
  with paging, a GDT, and a 64 KiB stack already set up; calling into a
  `pub extern "C" fn _start()` is sufficient. The architecture overview's
  mention of a "NASM boot stub" remains accurate for the context-switch
  path, which is a Phase 1+ concern.
- **Limine fetched on first build, not vendored.** xtask pulls the
  pinned `v12.2.0` release tarball into `tools/build-cache/limine/` (in
  `.gitignore`) the first time it's needed. Keeps the repo binary-clean;
  reproducibility is anchored by the `LIMINE_VERSION` constant in
  `tools/xtask/src/main.rs`.
- **Raw GPT+FAT32 image via `sgdisk`/`mtools` rather than xorriso/ISO.**
  Matches the Limine C template's UEFI image path and the project's
  UEFI-only target. ISO support can be added later if BIOS bring-up
  becomes interesting.
- **Top-level `cargo xtask` alias.** `/.cargo/config.toml` aliases
  `xtask` to `run --manifest-path tools/Cargo.toml -p xtask --`. The
  kernel and tools workspaces are intentionally separate Cargo workspaces
  because they target different triples.
- **Directory renamed `xtools/` → `tools/`** to match the layout
  declared in the project CLAUDE.md.

Verification: a headless QEMU launch with a monitor-driven `screendump`
captured a framebuffer whose colour histogram exactly matches our
declared `Rgb::BG`, `Rgb::FG`, and `Rgb::ACCENT` palette, with the FG
and ACCENT pixel counts consistent with the rendered "NITROX KERNEL" and
"PHASE 0: BOOT OK" strings.

What's deferred to Phase 1+:

- IDT/IST setup, exception handling, double-fault stack
- Physical-memory bookkeeping (parsing Limine's memory map, buddy
  allocator, slab)
- Virtual-memory manager and the HHDM/kernel-half ranges
- IPC, notifications, scheduler, handle table
- Userspace (libkern, init)
- Logging surface beyond the framebuffer (kernel log handle, serial)
- Custom JSON target if we need anything the built-in doesn't expose
- Replacement of the hand-coded font with a PSF loader once an allocator
  exists
